## Assignments

1. Take an input(alpha numeric) from the user from command line. (greater than 50 characters and less than 150 )
a. Split the same into 5 equal parts and display 
b. Display the same in upper case and lower case on 5 different lines.
c. In case the last line is not equal buffer it in the end with Zeros and display.
d. Replace all occurrences of "H" and "h" with an integer  -1 ( or with any integer taken as input from the user)
e. Take care of error handling - from what you have learnt so far

Hint for c – 
Make the original string len a perfect multiple of 5 
Str = “000000000000000000000000000000000000000000…” – where len of this string is less than 150

2. Input an integer - max 256
a. Find the number of ones in binary
b. Print the same in binary
c. Repeat the same for a negative number

3. Define list of 20 elements
a. Have duplicates
b. Remove all duplicates
c. Error handling

4. Input 3 number a<b<c
a. print the number starting from a to c in multiples of B

5. Input 10 integers - Sort them without sort function in list

6. Accept user input and check if the input is a pallindrome

7. Accept your DOB in mm:dd:yy:hh:mm
a. Time of birth
b. Find the number of hours that has passed since birth
PS: you can hardcode current time
